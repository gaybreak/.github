# gaybreak

Hi! We're the team behind [daybreak](https://github.com/gaybreak/daybreak)!

## So who are you?

It's just [mars](https://github.com/bulletsabbath) and [lara](https://github.com/laralove143)
for now, that may or may not change in the future

### I like the idea! How can I help?

You can create issues for feature-requests and bugs or contribute, please do actually!

### Why the name daybreak?

This is the opposite of [twilight](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight) in a
lot of ways, so we thought the name should be the opposite of it too

We thought about a lot of other stuff like discrust but they were all taken :(

### Why's the organization name gaybreak and not daybreak

daybreak was taken, we could do daybreak-rs yeah but gaybreak was too tempting... also this is made by an LGBT team
