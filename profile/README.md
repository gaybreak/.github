# Gaybreak

Hi! We're the team behind [Daybreak](https://github.com/gaybreak/daybreak)!

## So who are you?

It's just [Mars](https://github.com/bulletsabbath) (and [Lara](https://github.com/laralove143) helping but not in the org :0)
for now, that may or may not change in the future

### I like the idea! How can I help?

You can create issues for feature-requests and bugs or contribute, please do actually!

### Why the name daybreak?

This is the opposite of [Twilight](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight) in a
lot of ways, so we thought the name should be the opposite of it too

We thought about a lot of other stuff like Discrust but they were all taken :(

### Why's the organization name Gaybreak and not Daybreak

Daybreak was taken, we could do daybreak-rs yeah but Gaybreak was too tempting... Also this is made by an LGBT team
